class LowPassFilters(torch.nn.Module):
    """
    Bank of low pass filters. Note that a high pass or band pass filter can easily
    be implemented by substracting a same signal processed with low pass filters with different
    frequencies (see `julius.bands.SplitBands` for instance).
    This uses a windowed sinc filter, very similar to the one used in
    `julius.resample`. However, because we do not change the sample rate here,
    this filter can be much more efficiently implemented using the FFT convolution from
    `julius.fftconv`.

    Args:
        cutoffs (list[float]): list of cutoff frequencies, in [0, 0.5] expressed as `f/f_s` where
            f_s is the samplerate and `f` is the cutoff frequency.
            The upper limit is 0.5, because a signal sampled at `f_s` contains only
            frequencies under `f_s / 2`.
        stride (int): how much to decimate the output. Keep in mind that decimation
            of the output is only acceptable if the cutoff frequency is under `1/ (2 * stride)`
            of the original sampling rate.
        pad (bool): if True, appropriately pad the input with zero over the edge. If `stride=1`,
            the output will have the same length as the input.
        zeros (float): Number of zero crossings to keep.
            Controls the receptive field of the Finite Impulse Response filter.
            For lowpass filters with low cutoff frequency, e.g. 40Hz at 44.1kHz,
            it is a bad idea to set this to a high value.
            This is likely appropriate for most use. Lower values
            will result in a faster filter, but with a slower attenuation around the
            cutoff frequency.
        fft (bool or None): if True, uses `julius.fftconv` rather than PyTorch convolutions.
            If False, uses PyTorch convolutions. If None, either one will be chosen automatically
            depending on the effective filter size.


    ..warning::
        All the filters will use the same filter size, aligned on the lowest
        frequency provided. If you combine a lot of filters with very diverse frequencies, it might
        be more efficient to split them over multiple modules with similar frequencies.

    Shape:

        - Input: `[*, T]`
        - Output: `[F, *, T']`, with `T'=T` if `pad` is True and `stride` is 1, and
            `F` is the numer of cutoff frequencies.
